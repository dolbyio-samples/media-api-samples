## Environment Variables

Most of these samples expect you to define environment variables so
that you don't have to put your API Key into source code. To make this
easier we've included an example `bash` script to initialize these
variables. This is optional and just provided as a convenience. You can
edit the samples to meet your needs.

Recommended Workflow

1. Copy "env.sh" to "my-env.sh"
2. Replace variable with your API Key
3. Execute ". my-env.sh" to initialize these variables into your environment

If you are not using a `bash` shell you'll need to change this to be correct
for your working environment.
